# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data to gain insights into customer behaviour, sales patterns, and performance across different product categories and locations. Using Python for visualization and DBMS for data management, the project explores trends and patterns to enhance data-driven decision-making.

Objectives:
1.	Data Management and Storage:
•	To design a structured database using a DBMS (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of Walmart sales data.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
To preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, formatting columns (e.g., dates and times), and ensuring data consistency for accurate analysis.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	To analyze customer demographics, product sales trends, and branch performance using descriptive statistics.
4.	 Sales Performance Analysis:
•	To identify the best-performing branches and product lines based on revenue, quantity sold, and gross income.
5.	Customer Behavior Insights:
•	To examine the relationship between customer type, gender, and payment methods and their impact on sales trends.
6.	Actionable Recommendations:
•	To provide data-driven insights that can help Walmart improve customer satisfaction, optimize inventory, and increase sales.

Key Features
1.	Comprehensive Data Analysis:
o	Analysis of customer demographics (gender, customer type, and location).
o	Exploration of product line performance across branches.
2.	Visualization Using Python:
o	Interactive charts to illustrate key metrics such as total sales, product preferences, and ratings.
o	Visual representation of sales trends by date and time.
3.	Database Integration:
o	Efficient management and querying of sales data using DBMS.
o	Implementation of structured queries for insights like top-performing branches and products.
4.	Key Insights Uncovered:
o	Correlation between payment methods and customer type.
o	Impact of ratings on gross income across product lines.

Tools Used:
1.  Python Programming Language:
•	Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: To create visually appealing charts and graphs for sales trends, product performance, and customer demographics.
•	NumPy: For numerical computations and calculations.
•	Plotly: For interactive visualizations to enhance the exploration of data insights.
2.  Database Management System (DBMS):
•	MySQL/PostgreSQL: Used to store, query, and manage the Walmart sales dataset efficiently.
•	SQL queries for extracting, grouping, and analyzing key metrics like branch-wise performance, customer demographics, and payment trends.
3. Jupyter Notebook/Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
•	To write and test Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
4. Excel/CSV File Management:
•	To handle the raw dataset and export processed results for reporting.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of DBMS and Python visualization tools to extract valuable insights from Walmart sales data. The analysis reveals critical patterns in customer behaviour, product preferences, and branch performance, offering actionable recommendations for business optimization. By leveraging structured data management and visualization, this project emphasizes the importance of data analytics in retail decision-making.
